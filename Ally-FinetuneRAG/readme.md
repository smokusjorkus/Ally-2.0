# Ally-FinetuneRAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Context Classification feature for the ALLY Legal Assistant chatbot. This is a submodule of the main ALLY project.

## Features

- **RAG System**: Semantic search through Philippine Supreme Court cases
- **DeepSeek V4 Flash**: DeepSeek for classifying legal-specific responses and routing queries (Context Classification)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (production) / Qdrant (local testing)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- pip
- at least 2GB RAM free (for embeddings model)
- Pinecone (for cloud vector database)
- DeepSeek API key

## Installation

### 1. Create and activate virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell

## Usage

### Production Setup (Pinecone Cloud) - ONE-TIME SETUP (or if new case data are added)

#### 1. Process CSV data
```bash
python scripts/1_process_csv.py
```
Processes cases from `ally-dataset/csv-dataset/` into chunks stored in `processed-for-rag/chunks.jsonl`.

**Output:**
- `processed-for-rag/chunks.jsonl` - All case chunks with embeddings metadata
- `processed-for-rag/processing_metadata.json` - Processing statistics

**What it does:**
- Loads all CSV files from dataset folder
- Extracts case information (facts, decision, ruling, verdict)
- Categorizes cases (criminal, civil, labor, commercial, family, tax, administrative, land)
- Splits each case into semantic chunks

#### 2. Upload vectors to Pinecone (RUN ONLY ONCE, IF DB IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED)
```bash
python scripts/2_index_pinecone.py
```
Uploads all processed chunks as vectors to Pinecone cloud. **This only needs to be run ONCE** (if new database).
Feat: Auto-Resume, If internet fails or you press Ctrl+C, run the script again to resume exactly where you left off.

**THIS WILL TAKE HOURS** depending on dataset size.

**!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!**
- Prepare your device to run minimum 6 hours non-stop.
- Plug your laptop into a power source. Do not run on battery, as performance throttling may slow down the upload or the system might die mid-process.
- Close other applicationss to minimize overheating.

#### 3. Update Pinecone (If new chunks/data are added, RUN THIS)
```bash
python scripts/3_update_pinecone.py
```
Use this script when you've added new cases to the dataset and want to upload only the new chunks without re-uploading everything.
Note: Process CSV first to convert to chunks.

#### 4. Test query system (Terminal Run)
```bash
python scripts/3_query_system.py
```
Opens an interactive terminal to test queries against the RAG system using Pinecone.

**Example queries:**
- "What is the legal definition of murder in the Philippines?"
- "Can an employer terminate an employee without just cause?"
- "What are the requirements for annulment?"

### Testing & Development

#### Test DeepSeek integration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Can an employer fire me without notice?"}'
```
Tests connection to the configured DeepSeek model for context classification.

### Production (Integration with Main App)

#### Run FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The main Spring Boot application will communicate with this API endpoint.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - API info
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/query` - Query the legal assistant (RAG pipeline)
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the legal definition of libel?",
    "limit": 5,
    "score_threshold": 0.7
  }
  ```
  
  **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Libel is defined as...",
    "sources": [
      {
        "case_number": "G.R. No. 123456",
        "case_title": "People v. Doe",
        "chunk_type": "ruling",
        "score": "87.5%",
        "category": "criminal"
      }
    ],
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "query": "What is the legal definition of libel?",
    "warning": null
  }
  ```


**Example curl request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"How do I report an Illegal Recruitment?"}'
```

## Context Classification with DeepSeek

The system uses DeepSeek to classify user queries and route them appropriately:

### Classification Categories

1. **Legal Query** - Requires RAG system
   - Questions about Philippine law
   - Supreme Court case inquiries
   - Legal procedures and definitions

2. **Greeting/Chitchat** - Simple response
   - Hello, hi, how are you
   - Thank you, goodbye
   - General conversation

3. **Out of Scope** - Redirect to appropriate resource
   - Medical advice
   - Financial planning
   - Technical support
   - Other non-legal topics

### How Classification Works

```python
# Example classification flow
query = "Can an employer fire me without notice?"
classification = classify_query(query)

if classification == "legal":
    # Route to RAG system
    result = ally.query(query)
elif classification == "greeting":
    # Simple response
    return "Hello! How can I help with your legal question?"
else:
    # Out of scope
    return "I specialize in Philippine legal information..."
```

## Integration with Main Project

This RAG system is called by the main Spring Boot backend:
```
React Frontend (Vite)
       ↓
Spring Boot + Ally-Tuned AI Model(Port 8080)
       ↓
Ally-FinetuneRAG FastAPI (Port 8000)
       ↓
Pinecone Cloud Vector DB 
```

The Spring Boot `ALLYService` makes HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000/api/query`.

## Local Testing (OPTIONAL)

For local development and testing without using Pinecone credits, you can optionally use the scripts in `localrun-scripts/` with Qdrant local database:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand local testing steps</b></summary>

### Local Setup with Qdrant (Optional)

#### 1. Process CSV (same as production)
```bash
python localrun-scripts/1_loc_process_csv.py
```

#### 2. Build local Qdrant vector database
```bash
python localrun-scripts/2_loc_index_vectordb.py
```
Creates local SQLite-based Qdrant database in `vector-db/`.

#### 3. Ingest data into local vector database
```bash
python localrun-scripts/3_loc_ingest_data.py
```
Uploads processed chunks to local Qdrant database. Useful for incremental updates.

#### 4. Test with local database
```bash
python localrun-scripts/4_loc_query_system.py
```
Interactive mode using local Qdrant database instead of Pinecone.

**Note:** Local testing is optional and primarily useful for development without consuming Pinecone API credits.

## Troubleshooting

### Pinecone connection errors
- Verify `PINECONE_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`
- Check Pinecone index exists with name `ally-supreme-court-cases`
- Ensure index dimensions match embedding model (1024)
- Verify index region is accessible

### Model connection errors
- Verify `.env` or Render has a valid `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- Verify `DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash`
- Test with `POST /api/validate`

### Slow indexing
- Pinecone upload takes hours (depending on size) for full dataset
- Batch size can be adjusted in `2_index_pinecone.py` (default: 250)
- Embedding model is cached after first run

### Memory issues
- Embedding model requires ~2GB RAM (CLOSE OTHER APPLICATIONS)
- Reduce batch size in scripts if needed
- Consider using a machine with more RAM for initial indexing

### "Index not found" error
- Make sure you created the Pinecone index manually first
- Index name in `.env` must match Pinecone console
- Wait a few seconds after creating index before uploading

### Local Qdrant errors (if using local testing)
- Confirm `vector-db/` folder exists (run `localrun-scripts/2_loc_index_vectordb.py`)
- Check Qdrant database is not corrupted
- Delete `vector-db/` and rebuild if needed

### Context classification issues
- Ensure `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set
- Verify `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com`
- Test with `POST /api/validate`


## Model Information

- **Embeddings**: [BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) (1024 dimensions)
- **Classification**: DeepSeek V4 Flash for context classification and query routing
- **Vector DB (Production)**: Pinecone (cloud-hosted)
- **Vector DB (Local - Optional)**: Qdrant (SQLite-based)

## Development Notes

- **Production** uses Pinecone for scalability and reliability
- **Local testing** (optional) uses Qdrant to avoid consuming Pinecone credits during development
- Both systems use the same embedding model for consistency
- Scripts in `scripts/` are for production (Pinecone)
- Scripts in `localrun-scripts/` are optional, for local development (Qdrant)
- Context classification routes queries before hitting the RAG system
